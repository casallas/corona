Corona Coding Guidelines:

Syntax:
  Pretty straightforward...  just try to write clear code and follow
  the rest of the library's style.

Semantics:
  When you write or read data to or from a file, don't read one byte
  at a time.  Read as large of a buffer as you can, and then process
  the data in memory.  Remember:  Each read operation is a virtual
  function *and* a system call.
